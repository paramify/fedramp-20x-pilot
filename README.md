# Paramify's FedRAMP 20x Phase One Pilot Submission

## Paramify Overview

The **Paramify Cloud** (Paramify) is a software platform running in AWS GovCloud that automates risk management processes‚Äîincluding compliance planning, solution implementation, gap assessments, and documentation‚Äîfor cloud service providers, government agencies, and members of the Defense Industrial Base (DIB). It supports compliance with NIST 800-53 (FedRAMP, FISMA, GovRAMP), NIST 800-171 (CMMC), SOC 2, HIPAA, ISO 27001, and more.


#### Key Features:
- **SSP & ATO Management**  
  Import SSPs, identify system elements, generate OSCAL and human-readable packages.
- **Control Optimization**  
  Track progress and responsibilities via dashboard.
- **Change Management**  
  Auto-sync updates across documentation and profiles.
- **Continuous Monitoring**  
  Automate POA&M, detect duplicates, adjust risk, and reconcile inventory.
- **Integrations**  
  Integrate with issue management tools and manage evidence via open API.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è CSP Approach

Our approach can be summarized with the following steps:

1. **Lightweight Documentation**  
   Document the implementation of our KSIs using Paramify Cloud using our FedRAMP 20x control set.

2. **Key Security Indicators and Validations**  
   Gather and upload evidence into Paramify Cloud for each KSI validation, using automation where possible.

3. **Validate Evidence**  
    Meet with 3PAO and have them review and validate evidence in Paramify Cloud.

4. **Automate Machine-readable Package**  
   Publish our machine readable format package using Paramify Cloud.

5. **3PAO Review**  
   3PAO reviews the package and adds attestation.

6. **Continuous Reporting Indication**  
   Either on demand or per an automated schedule, a new package will be generated with the most current evidence.

7. **Prototype for Continuous Reporting**  
   It is anticipated that Paramify Cloud will allow for a shareable link that shows the KSI dashboard.

8. **CSP Rationale and Summary**  
   Summary of and rationale for the approach used to generate the machine-readable file, and evidence generation methods.

9. **CSP Submission**  
   Similar to the Continuous Reporting capability, the package will be available either with a viewable link or through the machine-readable package file with a friendly HTML viewer.

## Step-by-Step Details

### Step 1 ‚Äì Lightweight Documentation
Document the implementation of our KSIs using Paramify Cloud using our FedRAMP 20x control set.

### Step 2 ‚Äì Key Security Indicators and Validations
Gather and upload evidence into Paramify Cloud for each KSI validation, using automation where possible.

### Step 3 ‚Äì Validate Evidence
Meet with 3PAO and have them review and validate evidence in Paramify Cloud.

### Step 4 ‚Äì Automate Machine Readable Package
Publish our machine readable format package using Paramify Cloud‚Äôs DocRobot capabilities.
Our draft package submission is represented using YAML due to its simplicity.  Though YAML is our current proposal, Paramify can support OSCAL, JSON, or other common formats.

### Step 5 - 3PAO Review
3PAO reviews package and adds attestation.

### Step 6 - Continuous Reporting Indication
Either on demand or per an automated schedule, a new package will be generated with the most current evidence.

### Step 7 - Prototype for Continuous Reporting
It is anticipated that Paramify Cloud will allow for a shareable link that shows the KSI dashboard.

### Step 8 - CSP Rationale and Summary
Summary of and rationale for the approach used to generate the machine-readable file, and evidence generation methods.

### Step 8 - CSP Rationale and Summary
Summary of and rationale for the approach used to generate the machine-readable file, and evidence generation methods.

### Step 9 - CSP Submission
Similar to the Continuous Reporting capability, the package will be available either with a viewable link or through the machine-readable package file with a friendly HTML viewer.
