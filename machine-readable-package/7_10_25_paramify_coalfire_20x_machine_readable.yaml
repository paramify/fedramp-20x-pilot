  summaryOfCSO: |
   'The Paramify Cloud (Paramify) is a software platform that automates risk management processes-including compliance planning, solution implementation, gap assessments, and documentation-for cloud service providers, government agencies, and members of the Defense Industrial Base (DIB). Paramify supports adherence to control catalog requirements including NIST 800-53 (FedRAMP, FISMA, GovRAMP, TX-RAMP), NIST 800-171 (CMMC), and standards such as SOC 2, HIPAA, and ISO 27001, with support for additional catalogs and profiles continually expanding. SSP and ATO Package Management - Fast and Easy Setup: Upload previous SSPs or use the intake process to identify your system's elements and security capabilities. Paramify then generates a roadmap to support your risk management and compliance objectives. - Streamlined Control Implementation & Optimization: Visualize progress and manage security program capabilities through a unified dashboard that tracks system elements and responsibilities. - ATO Package Generation: Produce accurate SSP documentation in both digital (OSCAL) and human-readable formats, with flexible export options that support various file types, including but not limited to OSCAL, PDF, Word, and Excel. - Incorporate Changes Efficiently: As your risk management approach evolves, maintaining stack profiles in Paramify reduces manual update errors across documentation. Paramify automatically synchronizes updates to your SSP, CRM, CIS, policies, procedures, and other records to support compliance with evolving data protection requirements. Continuous Monitoring and Issue Management - Automated POA&M Documentation: Automatically manage and update POA&M documentation via a centralized task-priority view, eliminating the need to manage from multiple spreadsheets or scan files. - Vulnerability Management with Duplicate Detection: Automatically close resolved vulnerabilities and employ duplicate detection to ensure accurate issue tracking. - Automated Risk Adjustment: Apply risk adjustments across multiple issues automatically to support consistent prioritization of remediation efforts. - Automated Inventory Reconciliation: Configure and maintain inventory reconciliation rules to generate accurate workbooks automatically, without manual review of scan files-including those for ephemeral virtual hosts. Integration with Your Organization's Processes - Workflow Management: Integrate with issue management tools (e.g., Jira, ServiceNow, GitLab) to facilitate collaboration between DevOps and security teams for timely issue remediation. - Evidence Management: Unified evidence approach that minimizes or eliminates duplicate collection efforts. - API Integrations: Paramify's open API supports custom integrations with system components to facilitate connectivity and interoperability. Available in SaaS and self-hosted implementations.'

        'Coalfire Systems, Inc. (“Coalfire”), an American Association for Laboratory Accreditation (A2LA) accredited FedRAMP Third-Party Assessment Organization (3PAO), has partnered with Paramify to perform a FedRAMP 20x Validated Assessment. The objective of the assessment is to demonstrate compliance with Key Security Indicators (KSIs) established by FedRAMP for the 20x Phase One Pilot and to work towards FedRAMP authorization. Assessment activities took place between 06/25/2025 and 07/10/2025. Assessment activities were primarily performed directly within the Paramify web application. Paramify has developed a specific FedRAMP 20x program within the application that uses Paramify Risk Solutions to demonstrate compliance with KSIs. Risk Solutions are various security capabilities that are then mapped to requirements. In this case those requirements apply to FedRAMP 20x KSIs. Paramify has developed more than 290 unique Risk Solutions, of these 56 are mapped into the KSIs to detail how Paramify is securing their cloud service offering (CSO). Coalfire’s methodology for the FedRAMP 20x Validated Assessment is based on completeness, accuracy, timeliness, and exceptions when it comes to the automated and manual demonstration of the KSIs. To establish completeness, Coalfire reviewed the inventory and the scripts used to generate it to ensure that the list of applicable resources was identified. To establish accuracy, Coalfire reviewed the evidence provided within the application and ensured that the evidence derived from scripts, integrations, and documentation was representative of the asset inventory. To establish timeliness, Coalfire verified that the application maintains timestamps to ensure that evidence is relevant and that activity against requirements is tracked. To handle exceptions, Paramify allows for evidence, comments, and references to be added to each KSI implementation. Paramify reflects the status for each KSI that is displayed on the program dashboard. Based on the results of the assessment activities Coalfire has produced human-readable and machine-readable assessment reports. These reports detail the status of each KSI validation (True, False, Partial) and provide details on the tests and evidence reviewed by Coalfire in determining implementation status. All evidence was reviewed directly within the Paramify Cloud.'

                  result: Paramify utilizes a script to check AWS Config setup, check EventBridge rule for new resource detection, check SNS topic for alerts, and verify monitoring interval. Config recorder provides the detection of a new resource with the rule description indicating that it is designed to detect within 5 minutes of a new resource launched in AWS. Email notifications are received through SNS when a new resource is detected. The workflow is AWS Config > EventBridge > SNS > Email notification. Paramify manages merge requests in GitLab. Within GitLab there are approvals reflected for each merge request. Paramify has a process for tracking change requests which includes capturing the scope, impact, details of the change, schedule, rollback plan, and impact and security analysis.

              description: Execute changes through redeployment of version controlled immutable resources rather than direct modification wherever possible
              implementation: '#THIS ORGANIZATION uses @Terraform to install infrastructure services on @AWS GovCloud. Software is deployed to @EKS nodes using @Helm. The @Change Control Board meets weekly to review changes to Paramify Cloud, including @Helm and @Terraform scripts that reside in @GitLab. If a software reaches end-of-life, is not appropriately licensed, or critical threats are detected, the @Change Control Board and @DevOps Admin collaborate to identify an authorized replacement and scripts are updated.'

              - assessmentStep:
                  method: Manual
                  status: PASS
                  result: Paramify leverages Helm and Terraform scripts that reside in GitLab that allow for the redeployment of resources. Paramify makes update to code and goes through required testing and approvals. Once approved the change is then able to be pushed to production to implement any required updates or changes. Evidence of merge requests showing the approvals taking place and use of terraform was provided. There is a main branch for govcloud-infrastructure-in-terraform. Paramify provided the Terraform state files for both pre and prod environments showing that infrastructure is managed as code.

              implementation: During development and testing, the @DevOps Admin and @Developer analyze builds for vulnerabilities using @GitLab. Security flaws trigger a ticket in @Linear for the @Developer to fix. Only approved builds move to production. Remediation progress is monitored by the @DevOps Admin.

                  result: Paramify receives scanner outputs that require triage in Linear. Paramify uses the Premium software-as-a-service (SaaS) Plan within GitLab which supports additional testing and verification capabilities. Grype is also used as part of CI/CD pipeline scanning to identify issues. These are then tracked in merge requests to remediate prior to deploying to production. RIZ 370 scanner was also used to identify issues in code.

                    Paramify provided script output for kubectl which manages Kubernetes clusters. This allows for hardening actions to take place such as setting multiple areas of \"allowPrivilegeEscalation\" to false and tagging specific functions as 'privileged' to limit access. The script output provides information on the least privilege summary."

When suspicious activity is detected, @SentinelOne automatically disables the involved account in @Okta and sends an alert to the @InfoSec Admin. @InfoSec Admin configures audit logs from @Okta IDaaS and @Amazon CloudTrail to be monitored in @SentinelOne and responds to alerts of suspicious activity by marking alerts as true positive or false positive.

                  result: Paramify provided evidence of slack integrations with SentinelOne alerting, evidence of custom rules in SentinelOne, evidence of log analysis in the Singularity Data Lake, and evidence of alert that are configured in SentinelOne via Star Custom Rules. Paramify gets the alert in SentinelOne and then must perform account securing actions where needed. This involves analysis of the alert and then taking the necessary action.

              implementation: During development and testing, the @DevOps Admin and @Developer analyze builds for vulnerabilities using @GitLab. Security flaws trigger a ticket in @Linear for the @Developer to fix. Only approved builds move to production. Remediation progress is monitored by the @DevOps Admin.

                  result: Paramify leverages GitLab for release development. There are requirements to approve a release prior to moving it to production. This involves SAST through semgrep, dependency auditing, container vulnerability scanning with Grype. Builds are executed using Kaniko, applications are deployed to Kubernetes via kubectl only on merge to main, and a review environment is stood up to support evaluation.

              implementation: Paramify Cloud uses @S3, a FedRAMP 20x Phase One-compliant cloud component that enables automated backups and restoration. The @DevOps Admin configures Paramify Cloud to utilize multiple zones, with essential information backed up to @S3, allowing for roll back to a known state within 2 hours. The @DevOps Admin has a documented recovery playlist in @Google Drive to aid in coordination of the roll back process.

              implementation: 'The @DevOps Admin maintains a current baseline configuration of Paramify Cloud in @GitLab, as outlined in the @Configuration Management Plan. This includes: Hardening Paramify Cloud for security while maintaining functionality. Enabling only essential ports, protocols, and services. Ensuring associated accounts are secure and compliant. Disabling non-essential functions, ports, protocols, and services. Adhering to the principle of least privilege for device operations and access. Authorized personnel approve, test, and deploy any changes to these baselines through the @Change Management Process, with updates documented in @GitLab.'

                  result: Hardening and reviews are done through the use of AWS Config conformance packs to identify areas of non-compliance with various benchmarks. AWS Config is used as a status and reporting mechanism to identify areas of non-compliance. There is a hardening script that is run in Kubernetes and the overall continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline has steps to harden the image and make sure it is in a good place prior to deployment.

              implementation: Paramify Cloud uses @AWS GovCloud, a FedRAMP 20x Phase One-compliant cloud component that meets data protection requirements. All customer data uploaded to Paramify Cloud by the customer in @AWS GovCloud are encrypted using @Amazon Server-Side Encryption, with AES-256 keys while they are stored within the environment. All disks that contain customer data are encrypted using OS level encryption. All encryption within the environment is done using a FIPS 140-2 validated module. The same encryption mechanisms are applied to backup systems and data stores that contain customer data.

                  result: Paramify manages infrastructure as code through Terraform. Infrastructure runs on Kubernetes clusters which uses Helm charts as packages to support the application. Paramify provided evidence of the Terraform script used to setup the Paramify application. Paramify pulls from Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR) for deployment. Development happens in Amazon US East/West and when a new container deployment is ready it is pushed into that Amazon ECR which is the source of truth for the Amazon GovCloud environment.

A merge request is then worked to apply the security patch to the environment. Grype is used as a static analysis tool to identify vulnerabilities that would then need to be worked by Paramify. There is a documented change management process which involves creating anew merge request with any Terraform and Helm configurations as part of a proposed change. There is a change control board which meets weekly. Merge requests must be approved.

              description: Monitor third party software information resources for upstream vulnerabilities, with contractual notification requirements or active monitoring services
              implementation: 'When a #THIS ORGANIZATION team seeks budget for services, they must outline functional requirements and conduct a cost-benefit analysis to decide between external vendors or internal development. If opting for a vendor, the @Vendor Risk Management Admin evaluates risks for compliance with Paramify Cloud''s supply chain standards. Following the @Vendor Risk Management Admin''s approval, the @Operations Admin grants final authorization for procuring the services.'

                  result: Monitoring of third-party services takes place through vendor evaluation and review/approval from an admin. There is the existing merge request process that involves testing, reviews, and approvals to take place to address initial issues. SentinelOne is running in the environment to detect any issues. SentinelOne has their own security feed that updates to support detection of vulnerabilities. Evidence was provided that Paramify gets email notification from SentinelOne when there is a new agent package available.
